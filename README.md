### Development
Every file related to the program source is in the "app" folder.
The assets folder is used for files that need to be accessed by their path.

There are two entry points for the program:
- **run.ts:** This is the entry point for Electron which opens the window.
- **index.ts:** This is the entry point for the app itself. This is the script that's started by the index.html.
